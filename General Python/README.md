Follow the contents of this repository marked as Day wise

## Day-Wise (Where is Day 1?)
- Day 1: Explore notes pdf and research about it
- Day 2 onwards, follow the drill...

## NOTES?
The pdf attached is the resource used by our Python Trainer Mr. Vinayak Dubey in our 5th Semester. There's no clue who the original author of the pdf is. But it's a damn good resource

## Advise
Follow the official documentation along with GeeksForGeeks, W3Schools and other documentations instead of only AI. 
Utilise AI for logic building and use it to induce the approach of the solution instead of copy pasting the solution.
