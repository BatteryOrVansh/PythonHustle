# Python Hustle

This repository contains the practice problems in Python and its Applications that I underwent through my college semesters
One folder is dedicated to Data Visualisation and one is dedicated to the general practice problems of Python, exploring its syntax and functions.

## How can you benefit from it?
- Explore the General Python folder which has files marked Day-wise. Each day contains enough problems to get familiar with the syntax and feed the methods/functions in muscle memory.
- General Python folder contains a concise notes pdf with same practice problems after the topic explanations.
- Data Visualisation is one key folder which explores the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries of Python. It is recommended for those who have an understanding of those libraries and want to figure out the syntax and variety of techniques for practice.

## My aim with this repo.
It's just to store my code and build engagement on my github profile. 
Python is a great language and this folder represents my affection for it.

Happy Learning.
